# 🔧 FPGA-Based Control System

**By Ayush Garg and Alan Wang**  
_16-299: Introduction to Feedback Control Systems, Instructor: Professor Christopher Atkeson_

Welcome to our course project page! This project explores how **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** can be used to implement **high-frequency control systems and image processing algorithms** directly in hardware using **SystemVerilog**.

After several weeks of design, simulation, and hardware implementation, we have successfully completed and demonstrated the project.

## 💡 Why FPGAs for Control?

FPGAs offer key advantages for robotics and control applications:

- 🕒 **Real-Time Speed**: No OS or software stack — pure hardware-level execution  
- 🧠 **Parallelism**: Execute multiple control steps simultaneously  
- ⚙️ **Customization**: Hardware tailored exactly to the control problem

We implemented a **PID-style feedback controller** and a **simple image-processing pipeline** fully on the FPGA fabric.

## ✅ What We Accomplished

- ✅ Designed a **custom controller datapath** in SystemVerilog  
- ✅ Built a **UART interface** for PC communication (with fallback to GPIO)  
- ✅ Synthesized and deployed to FPGA hardware  
- ✅ Captured a successful real-time control demo on video  
- ✅ Documented everything for reproducibility

## 🛠 Reproducing the Project

Want to build on or replicate our work? Follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repo
### 2. Using an FPGA-accessible computer (found in Hamerschlag Hall ECE Labs), run and synthesize the SystemVerilog code and program this onto the FPGA.
### 3. Turn on the robot and program its Arduino with the repository's Arduino code from this Repo using a personal computer (laptop or separate desktop).
### 4. Run the Python script on a camera-accessible computer (separate from the computer used in Step 2) to communicate between the camera, the FPGA, and the robot.
### 5. Use a piece of paper with distinctly different colors near the center to let the camera images detect color movement in.
### 6. Run the transmit/receive command from the FPGA-accessible computer to allow the FPGA to transmit and receive commands.
### 7. Using the paper with a distinct color, move it left and right with the camera, and you can see the robot reflect these motions physically!

## 🧠 How to Improve Upon Our Results

While our project successfully demonstrated FPGA-based control and image processing, there are several ways to build on this work listed below:

- Extend the image processing pipeline, e.g., edge detection or basic filters
- Scale the design to control multiple devices in parallel
- Create a GUI or web interface for live tuning and visualization
- Use a higher-capacity FPGA to explore more complex or multi-threaded designs

These extensions would increase the project’s robustness, usability, and real-world applicability.

We also had some limitations to our project. Due to licensing issues, we were forced to utilize 2 separate computers on top of the FPGA and Arduino. This increased the latency of our system significantly. Future work can aim to improve upon these limitations.
