# üîß FPGA-Based Control System

**By Ayush Garg and Alan Wang**  
_16-299: Introduction to Feedback Control Systems_

Welcome to our course project page! This project explores how **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** can be used to implement **high-frequency control systems and image processing algorithms** directly in hardware using **SystemVerilog**.

After several weeks of design, simulation, and hardware implementation, we have successfully completed and demonstrated the project.

## üí° Why FPGAs for Control?

FPGAs offer key advantages for robotics and control applications:

- üïí **Real-Time Speed**: No OS or software stack ‚Äî pure hardware-level execution  
- üß† **Parallelism**: Execute multiple control steps simultaneously  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization**: Hardware tailored exactly to the control problem

We implemented a **PID-style feedback controller** and a **simple image-processing pipeline** fully on the FPGA fabric.

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

- ‚úÖ Designed a **custom controller datapath** in SystemVerilog  
- ‚úÖ Built a **UART interface** for PC communication (with fallback to GPIO)  
- ‚úÖ Synthesized and deployed to FPGA hardware  
- ‚úÖ Captured a successful real-time control demo on video  
- ‚úÖ Documented everything for reproducibility

## üõ† Reproducing the Project

Want to build on or replicate our work? Follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repo
### 2. Synthesize and Run SystemVerilog code on FPGA-accessible computers (found in Hamerschlag Hall ECE Labs)
### 3. Turn on robot and program it with Arduino code from this Repo (Robot Model: 4WD 60mm Mecanum Wheel Arduino Robot).
### 4. Run Python script on a camera-accessible computer to communicate between FPGA and robot.
### 5. Use a piece of paper with distinctly different colors near the center to let camera images detect color movement in.
